## Install

- Put [bender.zsh-theme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/specious/bender/master/bender.zsh-theme) in `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/`
- Set `ZSH_THEME="bender"` in your `~/.zshrc`
- Reload zsh configuration by running: `source ~/.zshrc`

Or you can use a zsh plugin manager such as [antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen), [zgen](https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen) or [zplug](https://github.com/zplug/zplug).

## Optional configuration

A minimal version of the prompt can be enabled by setting the following in your `~/.zshrc`:

```
BENDER_THEME_STYLE=mini
```
